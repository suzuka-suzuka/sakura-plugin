  prompt: Please turn this photo into a figure. Behind it, there should be a
    packaging box with a large clear front window, printed character artwork,
    the product name, logo, barcode, and a small specs or authenticity panel,
    with a small price tag sticker on one corner of the box. There is also a
    computer monitor screen at the back, showing the design sketch of the
    figure. In front of the box, on a round plastic base, place the figure
    version of the photo I gave you, and the figure must be three-dimensional.
    I’d like the PVC material to be clearly represented. It would be even better
    if the background is indoors.
